### Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
- Focus on edge cases that might result in unintended behavior with respect to user point, and gauge weight voting.
- Finding attack vectors that allow users to bypass the decay factor of their voting power.
- Any erroneous or redundant implementation.

### Approach taken in evaluating the codebase
- Manual review
- Foundry

### Architecture recommendations
Not reviewed due to limited scope

### Codebase quality analysis
- Documentation: good code documentation overall. Although some key logic such as `_checkpoint()` in VotingEscrow.sol could benefit more code comments for increased readability.

### Centralization risks
- GaugeController.sol is central to centralization resistance. Current implementations do require governance set weight for gauges (in contrary to sponsor's intent, see report for details). Given the situation, needs to ensure governance process is fair to prevent a single actor manipulate gauge weights.

### Mechanism review
- VotingEscrow.sol: `increaseAmount()` and `delegate()` have inherit risks for voting power manipulation. See report for details.

### Systemmic risks
- Voting power accounting. Same as mechanism review. There are inherit risks where voting power decay model can be violated which contributes to an unfair voting process.
