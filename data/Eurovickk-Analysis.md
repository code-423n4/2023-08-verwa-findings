So firstly i started by reading the contracts and trying to understand them, as well i put on paper some ideas of thing that i saw that could potencially be issues and to understand the idea of the proyect.

I learnd about Epoch-based Logic, i knew about RWA but haved never worked in a proyect that includes this caracteristic and i think i understood a little bit more about Solidity architecture.
