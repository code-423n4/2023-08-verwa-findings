## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase

- Started with the docs
- Then the codes in scope line by line
- Back to the docs to counter some notes I made while going through codebase
- Read through the messages in the discord chat group to see if any of my potential questions I have, has already been asked and answered.
- Asked some questions for clarification and better understanding of contracts logic.
- Finally then back to the codebase to sum up my reports/findings
  NB: I don't write my reports on the last day, but rather a few each day while working on a contest, so on the last day I must have gotten more context of the project and can then edit a few reports, finalize others or let them be, more of as the situation calls.

## Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase

Multiple things, to list a few:
- Curve DAO logic and implementation
- veCRV
- Canto RWA

## Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
During the audit, I thoroughly reviewed the contract's logic, data flow, and security measures, aiming to identify any potential vulnerabilities or issues that could impact its functionality or user experience. Every experience gained while auditing the project is well worth it. I look forward to receiving a feedback from the judges on the possible steps I can take to improve and potential flaws in my findings.
