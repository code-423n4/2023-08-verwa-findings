## [N-01] Use named parameters for mapping type declarations

Consider using named parameters in mappings (e.g. *mapping(address account => uint256 balance)*) to improve readability. This feature is present since Solidity 0.8.18.

## [N-02] Lack of address(0) checks in the constructor

Zero-address check should be used in the constructors, to avoid the risk of setting smth as address(0) at deploying time.

## [N-05] Event is missing *indexed* fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so itâ€™s not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (threefields). Each *event* should use three *indexed* fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

## [N-06] *0 address* check for *asset*

Check of the address to protect the code from 0x0 address problem just in case. This is best practice or instead of suggesting that they verify address != 0x0, you could add some good NatSpec comments explaining what is valid and what is invalid and what are the implications of accidentally using an invalid address.
