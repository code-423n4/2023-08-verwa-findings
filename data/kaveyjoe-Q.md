1 . Issue: Inconsistent Use of Mixed uint128 and uint256 Arithmetic
  - Location: In the vote_for_gauge_weights function
  - Description: The line uint256 slope = uint256(uint128(slope_)); casts the slope_ value from int128 to 
     uint256, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or data loss.

2 . Issue: Uninitialized Loop Counter in Internal Functions
- Location: In the _get_sum and _get_weight functions
- Description: The loop counters i are not explicitly initialized before the loop, which can lead to 
      unexpected behavior. They should be initialized to zero (uint256 i = 0) before the loop starts.

3 . Issue: Inconsistent Use of Compound Assignment Operators
- Location: In the _change_gauge_weight function
- Description: In the line power_used = power_used + new_slope.power - old_slope.power;, it's more readable and consistent to use the compound assignment operator (power_used += new_slope.power - old_slope.power;).

4 . Issue: Potential Division by Zero
- Location: In the _gauge_relative_weight function
- Description: The line return (MULTIPLIER * gauge_weight) / total_weight; could potentially result in a division by zero if total_weight is zero. A check should be added to ensure that total_weight is not zero before performing the division.

5 . Issue: Inconsistent Use of Math.max in Calculations
- Location: In the vote_for_gauge_weights function
- Description: In the lines where Math.max is used to adjust bias and slope values, the same adjustment should be made to both points_weight and points_sum to ensure consistency. Currently, only points_weight is adjusted.

6 . Issue: Incorrect Comparison in Loop Conditions
- Location: In the _get_sum and _get_weight functions
- Description: The loop conditions if (t > block.timestamp) should be replaced with if (t <= block.timestamp) to properly exit the loop when the condition is met. Additionally, the loop counters should be incremented (i++) within the loops.

7 . Issue: Unused Function Parameters
- Location: In the checkpoint and checkpoint_gauge functions
- Description: Both of these functions have unused parameters _gauge, which can be removed since they are not used within the functions.

8 . Issue: Inconsistent Use of Visibility Modifiers
- Location: In the _change_gauge_weight function
- Description: The _change_gauge_weight function is marked as internal, but it's intended to be called from the change_gauge_weight function, which has a public visibility modifier. Consider changing the visibility of _change_gauge_weight to private since it's not meant to be accessed externally.

9 . Issue: Unclear Variable Naming and Comments
- Location: Throughout the contract
- Description: Some variable names and comments may not accurately describe their purpose or functionality. Consider reviewing and updating variable names and comments to improve clarity and maintainability.

10 . Issue: Potentially Unreachable Code
- Location: In the _get_weight function
- Description: The else branch of the conditional statement if (t > 0) contains a return statement that returns 0. Since the if branch is checking whether t > 0, this else branch is likely unreachable and can be removed.
