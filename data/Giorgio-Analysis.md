For the evaluation of this codebase, for the first time I made a state machine, it was good practice to try it out with a smaller codebase. I personally found the curves logics a bit overwhelming for the given time frame, so I decided to focus on the parts that were not forked and the overall logic of the system.  
Since I had already made a state machine I think focusing on the logic of things was the right choice, even though I would have love to dive deep into the curve logic deeper.
