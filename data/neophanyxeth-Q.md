Centralizaion issue

The setRewards function is for setting reward distribution and whiteListLendingMarket function is for permitting for the governance address to whitelist or de-whitelist lending markets.
So these administrative powers given to a centralized entity can cause a centralization issue. If the governance address gets compromised or acts maliciously, it can impact the entire system.

mitigation:
Implement decentralized governance mechanism, where token holders or a DAO can make decisions instead of a single governance address. And in case of setRewards case, update the rewarding system such as automating the reward distribution based on some algorithms, instead of governance's manual set. And multi-sig can be used for whitelisting market.
