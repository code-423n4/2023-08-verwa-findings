## Approach taken in evaluating the codebase

- Read the protocol description in README.md to understand the overall structure and auditing scope
- Check the change point by comparing it with the forked project code
- Check the auditing report of the forked project
- Line-by-line review focusing on logic written directly without forking
- Check the test code to understand the intent of the function
- Add tests to test code to see if the vulnerability is actually triggered
- Writing reports, translating them into English

## Anything that you learned from evaluating the codebase

- A new way to count epochs
- Read vyper for the first time to compare with the ported project

## Any comments for the judge to contextualize your findings
